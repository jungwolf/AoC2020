Day08 challenge

I decided to turn the input.txt file into a bunch of insert statements. sqlldr, external tables, great when you have large datasets but overkill for ~1000 rows.

*_workbook* files are my interim work notes.
*_solution* files should have a clean solution with explainations.

example* files work through the example as a check on the basic concept.
part1_* are files related to working on part1 questions. Usually includes inserting the supplied input.txt file.
part2_* are files for the part2 challenge. Sometimes a trivial change, sometimes... not.
