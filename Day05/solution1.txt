/*
The seat assignments are stored in table day05_input column xline.
The seat assignments are a binary encoding using 'FBRL' as '0110' respectively

I create a function to translate binary strings stored in text into number.
  binary_string_to_number(varchar2) return number
*/

/*
read the input:
  select xline seat from day05_input

Use translate to turn the 'FBRL' characters into 0/1 digits
  select translate(seat,'FBRL','0110') bin, seat from (

The first 7 bits determine the row, the last 3 determine the column
I also return the full string for reasons
  select substr(bin,1,7) bin_row, substr(bin,8,3) bin_column, bin from (

The question never asks for the row or column, only seat_id!
In that case, convert the string to a number and find the max value.
  select max(binary_string_to_number(bin)) max_seat_id

-- this does the work if you want to work on row and column
select 
  max(binary_string_to_number(bin)) max_seat_id
from (
  select substr(bin,1,7) bin_row, substr(bin,8,3) bin_column, bin from (
    select translate(seat,'FBRL','0110') bin, seat from (
      select xline seat from day05_input
    )
  )
)

Below is the minimal answer.

-- run create_binary_string_to_number.sql first
select 
  max(binary_string_to_number(bin)) max_seat_id
from (
  select translate(seat,'FBRL','0110') bin from (
