Day09 challenge

part1_solution.txt and part2_solution.txt files have a clean solution with explainations.

part1_inserts.txt creates a table and inserts data from the day's puzzle input. 

*_workbook* files are my interim work notes.
example* files work through the example as a check on the basic concept.
part1_* are files related to working on part1 questions. Usually includes inserting the supplied input.txt file.
part2_* are files for the part2 challenge. Sometimes a trivial change, sometimes... not.
