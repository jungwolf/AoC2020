-- game of life with cubes
-- consider the current state to determine the next state
-- a cube has 26 neighbors, off-by-one in x,y,and/or z.
-- if cube is active, 2 or 3 active neighbors -> active, otherwise -> inactive
-- if cube is inactive, 3 active neighbors -> active, otherwise -> inactive

-- I think, this time, only keep track of active cubes.
-- for each active cube, add 1 to count of neighbors to all neighbor cubes
-- once complete, sweep through all potential cubes and follow a+2|3n -> a, i+3a ->a, otherwise i
